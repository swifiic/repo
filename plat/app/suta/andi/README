SUTA - SWiFiIC User Terminal App 

This app acts as a data provider for other apps of the SWiFiIC Ecosystem.



NOTE: This app may not run sometimes when using Eclipse - as for some reason 
Eclipse doesn't acknowledge the in-swifiic-andi library and won't compile it 
with the app. Manually edit .project file to add the library to the project.
